# Carpooling
Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car and prevents others from having to drive to a location themselves. Job employees here are specifically targeted.

# Project Description
:writing_hand: Carpooling is an android and iOS application that manages everything from one area to another, making it easy for people to work together, with many benefits such as ease of transportation, saving money, reducing pollution, and reducing traffic congestion.

:writing_hand: Many mobile apps can rent a vehicle online. But there is a substantial rental cost for the car :open_mouth: . Also, if they use their own vehicle, it will take as much time as the cost of petrol :red_car: :red_car: . It takes more time as they get stuck in considerable traffic while traveling in their car. This will reduce the time-consuming process as the traffic congestion on the road will be significantly reduced when several people travel together for work in a vehicle.

#### :computer: Software Requirements
- React Native
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- Visual Studio Code

#### :spiral_notepad: Future Work
:pen: :pen: Develop the entire system by adding Add Admin Panel, Location sharing between users, Developing a strategy to send a notification message between passenger & Driver, etc.

#### 	:full_moon_with_face: :full_moon_with_face: Motivation
- This will help provide a proper process for the people going for employment to arrange the transport as required.
- Various types of mobile applications are used for transportation in Sri Lanka. Take uber, pick me, for example. But those apps do book their car. No mobile app has ever been designed to bring this kind of people together. This allows car owners to see where they are going and where they want to go after putting themselves into the area around them. It will enable you to build a relationship between the vehicle owner and the passenger and travel together with a group of people.
